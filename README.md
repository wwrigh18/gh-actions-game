### Overview
This repository is a template designed to help you experiment with fun GitHub Actions.

### Instructions
To get started, create your own repository using this template.
Then, in your repository settings (Secrets and variables -> Actions), add two repository secrets:

**DISCORD_WEBHOOK** — the webhook URL provided on Canvas (keep this private, do not share this with others).

**NICKNAME** — choose a fun secret nickname, such as “bat man,” “007,” or “jacky chan”, “watermelon”, etc.

Once your secrets are set, try making changes: edit code, update documentation, or add tests. Check the course Discord server to see which badges you unlock!
